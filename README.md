# Hello world!

Thank you for checking out the configuration for my personal development environment. I am a full stack TS/JS engineer and I develop primarily using neovim. These are the dotfiles I use across MacOS and Linux. I hope you find some inspiration here.

## Theme

I am a big fan of the [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin) theme. I use the frappe variant for any application that it supports.
I prefer [Hasklug Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) for coding.

## Tools

Most of these tools should be readily available from the package manager of your choice, ie. homebrew, apt, pacman, etc.
Neovim plugins are managed by LazyVim.
